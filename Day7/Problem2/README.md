Ramu is given an array of numbers now he has to check for a super square matrix in the given array.

A super square matrix is a matrix such that every row sum, every column sum, and both
diagonal sums are all equal. 

The integers in the magic square do not have to be distinct. 
Every 1 x 1 grid is trivially a super square matrix 

Given an m x n integer grid , return the size (i.e., the side length k ) of the largest super square matrix that can be found
within this grid.



Example 1:

Input = 
4 5
7 1 4 5 6
2 5 1 6 4
1 5 4 3 2
1 2 7 3 4
Output: 3

Explanation: 

From the above array we have the following super square matrix of size 3 
5 1 6 
5 4 3
2 7 3 



The largest super square matrix has a size of 3.
Every row sum, column sum, and diagonal sum of this magic square is equal to 12.
- Row sums: 5+1+6 = 5+4+3 = 2+7+3 = 12
- Column sums: 5+5+2 = 1+4+7 = 6+3+3 = 12
- Diagonal sums: 5+4+3 = 6+4+2 = 12
